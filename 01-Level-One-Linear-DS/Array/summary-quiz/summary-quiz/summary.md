### Array
#### Key points :
- Array is a Linear data structure .
- Stores items at a at [contiguous locations](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/operating-systems/difference-between-contiguous-and-noncontiguous-memory-allocation/) . 
- Random Access
	- i-th item can be accessed in O(1) Time as we have the base address and every item or reference is of same size.
- Arrays are used to build other data structures
- array is not useful in places where we have operations like insert in the middle, delete from middle and search in a unsorted data.


Note:
- To implement any Data structure model keep in mind that you implement it as if it's full of elements or at least there exists some of them at least one . imagine that and start implementing upon and it will be easy that is a hack .
- We will implement in case of 
	- beginning 
	- At a given pos
	- At the end
