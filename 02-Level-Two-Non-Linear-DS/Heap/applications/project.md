# Project_1: Implement a Priority Queue using a Heap.
I recommend trying this project after you finish studying HEAP. 
Simple Application: Priority Queue Using Heap

Description:
Create a small program that simulates a priority queue using a heap data structure. Each element has a value, and the element with the highest (or lowest) priority is always processed first.

What the App Does:

Insert elements into the priority queue

Remove the highest priority element (root of the heap)

Display the current state of the heap

Why This App?
This application directly shows the core idea of heap:

the most important element is always at the top.

Concepts Learned:

Heap property (Min Heap or Max Heap)

Insert operation (heapify up)

Delete operation (heapify down)
