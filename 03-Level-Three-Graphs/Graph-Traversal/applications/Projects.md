## I recommend trying this project after you finish studying Graph. 

1) Campus Navigation App
An application designed to help students navigate a university campus efficiently. Buildings, halls, and facilities are represented as vertices, while walkways and roads are represented as edges. The app finds the shortest path between any two locations on campus and can suggest alternative routes when certain paths are unavailable.

2) Social Connection Analyzer
An application that analyzes relationships within a small social network. Each user is represented as a vertex and each connection as an edge. The app can detect friend groups, check whether two users are connected directly or indirectly, and suggest new connections based on mutual relationships.
